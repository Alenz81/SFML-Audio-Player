I used a library called SFML in the creation of this project

https://www.sfml-dev.org/

This is an audio player that plays audio files. 
You are able to speed up and slow down files, change their location in space, and change the background.

Uses concepts such as n-ary trees, linked lists, and more!!! It even has an undo feature!!!
